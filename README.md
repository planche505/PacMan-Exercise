# PacMan-Exercise

This exercise/"game" was assigned as part of the MIT full stack bootcamp. It has a button where you can add a new pacman image onto the window. A separate button activates a random change in position where the added pacmen move around and bounce off the walls.

Future changes could reverse the direction the pacmen are facing after they smash into a wall.
